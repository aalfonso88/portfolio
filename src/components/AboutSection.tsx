                    <mark className='hl-text'>In 2010</mark>, I started my journey in software development—first as a student, and five years later as a professional. It has been a challenging and exciting experience, taking me through different stages in my career.
                    After working in data science and ETL for some years, I became more interested in full-stack development, especially for web platforms. In 2022, I made the switch, and I feel it was the right choice.
                    Today, I’m excited about what the future can bring.

                    <mark className='hl-text'>In the last three years</mark>, working on software applications has helped me improve both my logical thinking
                    and my creativity, especially when designing clean and user-friendly interfaces.
                    This mix has been my biggest motivation.

                    I was born and raised in <mark className='hl-text'>Montevideo, Uruguay, in 1988</mark>.
                    With this simple portfolio, I want to give you a brief but clear idea of who I am and how I can help you on your projects. I hope we stay in touch and work together in the future.
